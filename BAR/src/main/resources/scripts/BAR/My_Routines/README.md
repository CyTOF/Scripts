# My Routines

_My Routines_ is the place where users can save their own scripts to be easily accessed
through the BAR menu hierarchy. More details are available on the [BAR wiki page][Wiki].
The local _My Routines_ directory is not managed by the BAR Update site.

The `BAR>My Routines>Management>` menu contains several convenient commands (themselves
implemented as scripts), including:


## Browse
Points [Commander][Utilities] to the _My Routines_ directory and activates it


## List
Prints the contents of the _My Routines_ directory to a dedicated window. Files can then
be opened in the Script Editor by double-click. This may be preferable to
[Shift-clicking](http://imagej.net/BAR#OpeningBAR) the menu bar


## Reveal Directory
Opens _My Routines_ in the file browser of the operating system


## Search Routines
A script that searches for content in this directory.
