#Snippets

[BAR][Home] Snippets. This directory is a depository of generic and reusable templates to be recycled
by BAR users. They are installed under `BAR>Snippets>`, a menu containing several other commands:

 - `List Snippets`: Prints the contents of this directory to a dedicated window. Files can then be
   opened in the Script Editor by double-click. This may be preferable to
   [Shift-clicking](http://imagej.net/BAR#OpeningBAR) the Menu bar
 - `Reveal Snippets`: Opens this directory in the file browser of the operating system
 - [`New Snippet...`](../BAR/README.md#bar-plugins): A Java plugin implementing a convenient way to
   generate new scripts. The prompt features a drop-down menu containing source code that pre-loads
   scripting additions stored in the [lib](../lib/README.md#lib) directory.
   ([Source code](../BAR/src/main/java/bar/plugin/SnippetCreator.java))

##List of Snippets
####[Extract Bouts From Tracks](./Extract_Bouts_From_Tracks.py)
A Jython script that segregates videotracked paths (e.g., those obtained from
[TrackMate](http://imagej.net/TrackMate)) into "Moving" and "Motionless" bouts
according to predefined spatial and temporal constraints.

####[List BARs](./List_BARs.groovy)
Retrieves a list of all scripts registered in the `BAR>` menu.

####[Median Filter](./Median_Filter.py)
A [Python](#python) script that exemplifies how to perform a filtering operation.

####[NN Distances](./NN_Distances.py)
A [Python](#python) script that calculates nearest neighbor distances from a 2D/3D list of centroid
coordinates.

####[Batch Processors](http://imagej.net/BAR#Batch_Processors)
These are scripts written in different languages that batch process images in a more customizable
way than the _Process>Batch>Macro_ built-in command. The scripts are modular in design, so that
routines to be applied to individual files are contained in a single function. Each _Batch Processor_
performs the following operations ([documentation page](http://imagej.net/BAR#Batch_Processors)):

 1. Take an input folder specified by the user
 2. Apply a series of operations to individual files of matched extension(s)
 3. Save processed files to a dedicated directory, so that no files are overwritten

In the current examples, both the Python (Jython) and ImageJ macro (IJM) implementation perform the
task of obfuscating filenames: 1) They copy images from one folder to another, 2) Rename their
filenames using a random string and 3) Log changes to a CSV table (so that id of randomized filename
can be traced back to the original file). This approach is useful for unbiased/blind analyses that
are sensitive to user interpretation.

#####[Process Folder IJM](./Process_Folder_IJM.ijm)
A batch processor written in the [IJ macro language](#imagej-macro-language).
([Walkthrough](http://imagej.net/BAR#IJ_Macro_Language))

#####[Process Folder PY](./Process_Folder_PY.py)
A batch processor written in [Python](#python).
([Walkthrough](http://imagej.net/BAR#Python))


####[Search BAR](./Search_BAR.bsh)
   A BeanShell script that searches for content in this directory.
