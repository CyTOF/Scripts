# Misc

This directories contain miscellaneous scripts that are not included in BAR releases.

## Capture Window
A Mac-specific macro that calls the _Grab.app_ (part of the Mac OS) to capture a snapshot
of an ImageJ window.

## Clipboard to Results
Imports numeric values (delimiter-separated values), copied to the clipboard into the
_Results_ table. It was of utility prior to BAR v1.1.7, when BARs that analyzed tabular
data could only read values from the main IJ "Results" table.
